## About Me
I am passionate about working hard to create functional and efficient code, and having fun along the way. I love learning new things! Whether it's ways to improve my coding skills, interesting history, new recipes, or even new tricks on my rollerskates.  When I'm not diving deep into lines of code, you can find me at the beach. The sun, sea, and sand are not just my happy place; it's my source of inspiration. I have also have a love for cartoons, especially Disney movies. The magic of animation never fails to amaze me. It's a reminder to keep the sense of wonder alive. As a developer, I channel this spirit of curiosity, and love for imagination into my work.So, whether you're looking to collaborate on a coding project, or discuss the latest Disney classics, I'm here and excited! Let's bring your digital dreams to life!

## References
This project was exciting for me and I learned so much along the way! I learned a lot from my class but outside of class I watched youtube videos from user: https://www.youtube.com/@SuperSimpleDev which helped me learn even more about HTML and CSS to create a functional and nice portfolio. His videos taught me how to take a logo for a website like I did with Github and LinkedIn, and link my profiles so that it would load in a new tab within the browser. I also learned how to style elements with the pseudo element:hover, like opacity. I took inspiration for the design of my portfolio from https://dev.to/scrimba/10-minimal-portfolio-examples-for-web-developers-who-arent-good-at-design-40gj. This was a great resource for me to decide what layout I wanted for the portfolio.

# Conclusion
I can't wait to keep building new projects, improving existing ones, and being able to update this portfolio with all the new and exciting things to come! ðŸŒŸ
